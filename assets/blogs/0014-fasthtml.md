# TODO: COMPLETE Web Development with FastHTML

# Getting Started with FastHTML in Docker

**FastHTML** is a next-generation Python web framework built around HTMX, letting you write ultra-light, interactive web apps with minimal boilerplate. In this tutorial, you‚Äôll learn how to:

1. Install FastHTML via **pip**  
2. Containerize your app with **Docker**  
3. Run a simple ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù example with HTMX interactivity

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**  
- **Docker** v20.10+ (with daemon running)  
- Familiarity with the command line  

---

## Installing FastHTML

First, install FastHTML into a local virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install python-fasthtml

Tip: FastHTML uses HTMX under the hood‚Äîno extra JavaScript is required!

‚∏ª

Writing Your First FastHTML App

Create a file main.py:

# main.py
from fasthtml.common import *

app, rt = fast_app()

# Root route: ‚ÄúHello World!‚Äù
@rt('/')
def get_root():
    return Div(
        P('Hello World!', id='greeting'),
        HxButton('Change Text', hx_get='/change')
    )

# HTMX endpoint: replace paragraph text
@rt('/change')
def get_change():
    return P('Nice to be here!', id='greeting')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    serve()  # starts on http://localhost:5001

	‚Ä¢	fast_app() sets up the FastHTML/HTMX runtime.
	‚Ä¢	HxButton generates <button hx-get="‚Ä¶"> for click-driven partial updates.
	‚Ä¢	serve() launches the built-in development server.

Run locally:

python main.py

Open http://localhost:5001 in your browser and click ‚ÄúChange Text.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Dockerizing Your App

Create a Dockerfile next to main.py:

# Use a slim Python base
FROM python:3.10-slim

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy only requirements first for caching
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy app source
COPY main.py .

# Expose default FastHTML port
EXPOSE 5001

# Run the app
CMD ["python", "main.py"]

And a requirements.txt:

python-fasthtml



‚∏ª

Building & Running the Container

Build the image:

docker build -t fasthtml-app .

Run the container:

docker run --rm -p 5001:5001 fasthtml-app

Now navigate to http://localhost:5001 and interact with your FastHTML app inside Docker!

‚∏ª

Example: Click-to-Change Text
	1.	Visit your app at http://localhost:5001.
	2.	Click the ‚ÄúChange Text‚Äù button.
	3.	Observe the <p> element update from ‚ÄúHello World!‚Äù to ‚ÄúNice to be here!‚Äù without a full page reload.

This HTML-over-the-wire approach, powered by HTMX and FastHTML, keeps your Python code concise and your user experience snappy.
